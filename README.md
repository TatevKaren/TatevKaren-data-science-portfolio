# Tatev Karen Aslanyan Portfolio
My Data Science Portfolio including **Case Studies** and **Research Projects** that I completed, which are solving a particular business problem or introducing a new product/algorithm. All case studies include a Case Study paper and codes. Addionally, I beleive in the global power of shared knowledge and science, so you can also find here my **Authored Papers** and **Blog Posts**. 




## Research Project/Authored Paper: New Recommender Algorithm LDA-LFM

**Why:** Most of the existing recommender systems are based only on the rating data, and they ignore other sources of information that might increase the quality of recommendations, such as textual reviews or user and item characteristics. Moreover, the majority of those systems are applicable only on small datasets and are unable to handle large datasets. <br><br>
**How:** We propose a new hybrid recommender algorithm that combines a rating modelling technique (i.e., Latent Factor Model) with a topic modelling method based on textual reviews (i.e., Latent Dirichlet Allocation), and we extend the algorithm such that it allows adding extra user- and item-specific information to the system. We evaluated the performance of the algorithm using Amazon.com datasets.

## Case Study in Multivariate Statistics

**Why:** To identify the top US cities with highest capital, urban growth and development for purposes for everyone looking to relocate to or within US for various purposes.<br><br>
**How:** Using Places Rated Almanac data to find the rankings of the cities in United States based on a single combination of 9 rating variables using Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Factor Analysis (FA). We also use Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to get more insights in this data and investigate the correlation between two sets of rating variables (if existing). <br>

## Case Study in Advanced Marketing Models (Missing Data Mechanisms)

**Why:** Most of the statistical methods and algorithms require complete data and using data with missing observations or entires can produce unreliable results.Therefore, it is important to know the reason for missingness in the data, itâ€™s effect on the analysis and how these missiing data entir3es can be imputed. <br><br>
**How:** Using Boston housing data with a model-based simulation to perform Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Method of Moments (MM) estimations when applying Single Imputation (SI) or Multiple Imputation (MI) imputation techniques while artificially adding missing data with 3 different missing data mechanisms Missing At Random(MAR), Missing Completely At Random(MCAR) and Missing Not At Random(MNAR).<br>

## Case Study in Advanced Marketing Models (FastMCD)

**Why:** Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is one of the most widely-used classification methods for predicting qualitative response variables but it is highly sensitive to the outliers and it produces unreliable results in case the data is contaminated. To improve the robustness of the LDA, itâ€™s necessary to consider robust estimators for means and covaraince matrices. The robustified LDA employs robust estimators for location and scatter to limit the impact of outliers in the data.<br><br>
**How:** Using FastMCD algorithm to compute robust estimators for location and scatter parameters for robustified LDA where we code the FastMCD function/algorithm manually in R and verify it's results with a FastMCD function from R library.<br>
